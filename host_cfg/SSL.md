### Installing SSL Certificate on domain with OpenSSL's Let's Encrypt

Firstly, ensure that you are able to SSH into your VPS as root. Then ensure that certbot isn't install in the system

Uninstall any system-default certbot by running either one of this command `sudo apt-get remove certbot`, `sudo dnf remove certbot`, or `sudo yum remove certbot`

Then install certbot by running in sequence `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install certbot`

If you have a firewall, which is very advised, run `sudo ufw allow 80` to allow HTTP's port 80 for the certificate to use

To actually create the certificate, you'd need to run some commands:

`sudo certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http -d YOUR_EXAMPLE_DOMAIN`

After having ran that command, run this one `sudo ls /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_EXAMPLE_DOMAIN` and if the result is similar to the one below, you are almost done
```bash
Output
cert.pem  chain.pem  fullchain.pem  privkey.pem  README
```

Now, for installing the SSL Certificate into Apache run those commands

`sudo certbot --apache`

`sudo certbot --apache -d YOUR_EXAMPLE_DOMAIN -d www.YOUR_EXAMPLE_DOMAIN`

Then, follow those steps
